# BasicProjects
Small projects I made during Python and Security courses:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hangman.py - a game of Hangman I wrote in Python
EncrptDecrypt.sh - bash code that allows users to encrypt or decrypt data using OpenSSL and aes-256-cbc encryption.
nmapScript.sh - bash code that allows users to scan their network based on different parametrs and output the results as an HTML file.
